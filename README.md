# Inventory-tracking
 This program represents an inventory tracking system that
 could be used in a small grocery store.  

 Reads from the binary input file, uses the command line, puts the data into a doubly-linked list creating the list.
 
 Prints the menu of choices, updates the inventory and writes
 the updated list to the binary file.
